First activity following the steps of Hello World from GitHub Documentation page.

I'm editing the `README.md` file in the new branch, named `readme-edits`
A little about me, my name's Christopher, and I like to study Software Development. I'm writing is the documentation instructions from [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world#step-3-make-and-commit-changes)
